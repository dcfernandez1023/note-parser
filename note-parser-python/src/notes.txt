The Cell
	The cell is the smallest unit of life that can perform all activities required for life
	Cells share characteristics 
	Two main forms
		Prokaryotic (no nucleus containing DNA)
		Eukaryotic (nucleus contains DNA)
	Chromosomes contain genetic material in the form of DNA
	Genes are units of inheritance that transmit information from parents to offspring

Chemical Context of Life
Atom
	Smallest unit of matter
	Consists of
		Protons (p+) - found in nucleus (positive charge)
		Neutrons (n0) - found in nucleus (no charge)
		Electron (e-) - (negative charge) 
	Electrons determine chemical activity of an atom
	Electrons move around the nucleus in orbitals
	Each orbital holds 2 electrons 
	Shells of an atom:
		1st shell ~ contains 1 orbital, 2 electrons maximum
		2nd+ shell ~ contains 4 orbitals, 8 electrons maximum
	Outermost shell = valence shell 
	# of unpaired electrons in valence shell = valence
	Atoms make bonds to fill valence and become more stable 
Periodic Table of Elements
	6 elements important for life
		Hydrogen
		Carbon
		Nitrogen
		Oxygen
		Phosphorus
		Sulfur 
	Atomic number of an element = number of protons (top left number of element on periodic table)
	In a neutral atom, the number of electrons = number of protons 
	Atomic mass = number of protons + number of neutrons 
	Isotope = version of an element with a different number of neutrons
	Atomic mass in the table is the average of possible masses, weighted based on abundance of each isotope
