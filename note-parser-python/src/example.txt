~~ NOTE PARSER OPTIONS ~~

Line Parser
  Description:
    - The most basic parser
	- Each line is regarded as an expression that can be used for flashcards, quizzes, etc.
  
	Example:
      ***
		"""
		This line will be an expression.
		This line will also be an expression
		yooooo
		The previous line was an expression, and so is this
		"""
	  ***
	

Sentence Parser
  Description:
	- Works best for notes that are taken in lines of sentences without bullet-point lists
	- Uses spaCy's NLP model to identify sentences in notes
	- Each identified sentence will be regarded as an expression that can be used for flashcards, quizzes, etc.
	
	Example:
	  ***
		"""
		- This is a sentence
		- This is another sentence
		- The note parser will identify sentences in your notes
		- As long as your notes resemble sentences and are somewhat grammatically correct, the parser should identify it  
		- If the results of the parser are not what you expected, then you will always have the option to manually change its results
		"""
	  ***
	
	  ***
		"""
		This is a sentence. This is another sentence. The note parser will identify sentences in your notes.
		As long as your notes resemble sentences and are somewhat gramatically correct,
		the parser should identify it.
		If the results of the parser are not what you expected, then you will always have the option to manually change its results.
		"""
	  ***


List Parser
  Description:
    - Works best for notes that are taken in bullet-point format 
	- Uses tabs to identify bullet-point lists 
	- Each identified list will be regarded as an expression that can be used for flashcards, quizzes, etc.
	
	Example:
	  ***
		"""
		Test List
			- This is a test bullet-point
				- Yoooooooo
			- Another test bullet-point
			- This entire list will be regarded as one expression
			- If the results of the parser are not what you expected, then you will always have the option to manually change its results
		
		This line will be taken as one expression
		So will this one
		"""
	  ***
	  

Category Parser
  Description:
    - Works best for notes that are separated into categories 
	- Similar to the list parser, except that non-tabbed lines are regarded as categories
	- Anything tabbed under the category will be regarded as an expression 
	- Each expression identified under a category can be used for flashcards, quizzes, etc.
	
	Example:
	  ***
		"""
		This is a Category                                         \
			- This is a bullet-point under a category               \__  *this is an expression
			- This is another bullet-point under the same category  /
				- This is a sub-bullet-point                       /
				
		This is another Category                               \__ *this is an expression
			- This is a bullet-point under a category          /
			
		This is not a category, but an expression, since there are no bullet-points underneath it
		"""
	  ***
